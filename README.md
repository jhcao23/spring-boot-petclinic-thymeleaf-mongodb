spring-boot based spring-petclinic with thymeleaf

I am trying to create a spring-boot based project for a hybrid of original spring-petclinic and thymeleaf based petclinic projects.
their original repositories are:
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic [https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git]
https://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleafexamples-petclinic [https://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleafexamples-petclinic.git]

on top of their hybrid, I am trying to use mongodb as logging DB; also, I hire QueryDSL for JPA & MongoDB to generate type-safe Queries.
Neo4j might be used to handle further relationship of owners based on their SNS connections, but not used for current moment.
